### Introduction
The for loop in C language is used to iterate the statements or a part of the program several times. It is frequently used to traverse the data structures like the array and linked list. Represents the initialization of the loop variable. More than one variable can be initialised.

### Sample For Loop code

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    // Example of a for loop in C
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
