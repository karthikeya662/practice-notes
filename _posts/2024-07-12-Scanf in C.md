# All about Scanf in C Language

In C programming language, scanf is a function that stands for Scan Formatted String. It is used to read data from stdin (standard input stream i.e. usually keyboard) and then writes the result into the given arguments.
1. It accepts character, string, and numeric data from the user using standard input.
2. scanf also uses format specifiers like printf.
### Scanf Syntax

int scanf( const char *format, ... );

Here,

1. int is the return type.
2. format is a string that contains the format specifiers(s).
3. “…” indicates that the function accepts a variable number of arguments.

### Sum of 2 Numbers using Scanf

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int num1, num2, sum;

    printf("Enter first number: ");

    scanf("%d", &num1);

    printf("Enter second number: ");

    scanf("%d", &num2);

     sum = num1 + num2;
     
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

    return 0;
}
